# Code Wars Practice

## About this Repo
I use Code Wars to stay fresh with JavaScript and practice solving interesting algorithmic problems. All of these solutions passed the test conditions, but I pasted them into Markdown files for better readability. Each file represents a single challenge with the prompt description and my solution.
